		<li><strong>What special features have you done, or attempted, in creating the site that we should know about?</strong></li>
			<p><i>I think the special feature that I've done so far is making all the forms and php process in a div container and make the date search display with words and numbers instead of just number example April 06 2017. </i></p>
		<li><strong>Which parts did you have trouble with?</strong></li>
			<p><i>I reckon the biggest part I find it difficult is the SQL query functions</i></p>
		<li><strong>What would you like to do better next time?</strong></li>
			<p><i>I want to make more testing to maintian quality assurance.</i></p>
		<li><strong>What references/sources you have used to help you learn how to create your website?</strong></li>

		<li><strong>What you have learnt along the way?</strong></li>
